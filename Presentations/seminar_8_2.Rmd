# Individual fishers face a great deal of risk

.pull-left[
- Not even the best fishers can predict exactly how much they will catch

- Uncertainty of catch and income may incentivize fishers to choose biologically sub-optimal strategies

- Fishers can manage risk through input use

    - Add more capital
    - Choose days to avoid fishing (temporal effort)
    - Diversify fishing portfolio (spatial effort)

- Limited access to financial tools to smooth risk

## _Push by UN and NGOs to use Insurance as a means to transfer fisher risk_

???

Easy for recreational fishers to shrug off uncertainty, but what if this catch is your livelihood? The incentives to ensure catch may suddenly be higher pushing fishers to choose strategies that hurt the underlying biomass

# Research Questions

## 1) Will index insurance change optimal input use?

## Index Insurance Evidence

- Empirically, maize farmers use more fertilizer in Kenya .small[(Sibiko et al., 2020)]

- Pastoralists stock more animals leading to environmental degradation .small[(Bulte et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2011)]

## .blue[Fishers maximize expected utility by selecting input and payouts]

Integrate a Just and Pope Production function to find input risk effects

.pull-left[
$$\begin{aligned}
y(E,z)&=E^\alpha+zE^{\frac{\beta}{2}} \\
z&\sim N(0,\sigma_z)
\end{aligned}$$
]

.pull-right[

When $\beta<0$, input risk decreasing

When $\beta>0$, input risk increasing
]

Where $y(E,z)$ is a fishers production function, $E$ is the input, $\alpha$ is mean production elasticity, $\beta$ is risk elasticity, and $z$ is random productivity shock. [Utility uses insurance contract](#math)

## .blue[Numerical simulation]

- Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 draws from copula linked marginal distributions

- Non-linear optimization algorithm maximizes input and payout choices

- Run 19,800 scenarios for each combination of input variables .small[[Risk Aversion, Basis Risk Correlation, Premium Loading Factor, Trigger Coverage, Input Risk Effects]]

## 2) First index insurance model to examine input use with risk effects

# Discussion

.bold[.blue[Index Insurance is feasible in fisheries, but will have different impacts depending on the risk effects of the input]]

## Immediate Questions

- Do you buy the risk effect specification and its importance?

- What other considerations would you consider for proving insurance feasibility?

## Future goals and questions

- Move to two input model with mixed risk effects

- Can we identify risk effects of a fishery without expensive and time-consuming empirical studies?

- Test correlations of fisheries with potential indices

# One previous attempt at fishing productivty insurance

Concluded a US RMA like revenue and yield insurance program would be unsuccessful. Instead better management is the solution (Herrmann et al., 2004)

1. Insurance cost deemed to high to US RMA standards

2. Difficulty in defining fishery peril (how exactly does weather impact a fisher?)

3. Moral hazard of "fishing the insurance"
  
  - Operators staying in when earning payouts instead of exiting
  
No definitive follow up study in 20 years and interest in fizzled out
  
<uc-blockquote>However, insurance may be possible in other fisheries. New insurance products and fishery technology have come online to improve viability of insurance. Behavior was ignored in determining fisher responses and there was no formalization of the full moral hazard effect </uc-blockquote>

---

# Moral Hazards will always influence behavior

##.bold[Moral Hazard]: .gold[*"Decisions by insured agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured"*]

## Two components of Moral Hazards

  -   "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  -   "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out


<uc-blockquote> Index Insurance negates "Chasing the Trigger", but is still subject to Risk Reduction and therefore may cause fishers to change their input decisions </uc-blockquote>
---

# There are three pathways for insurance to change behavior

1. Quid Pro Quo

  - Fishers want insurance and are willing to agree to conservation improving stipulations

2. Collection Action

  - Insurance leverages the political economy to pressure the regulator or promote collective cooperation

3. Moral Hazards

  - "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  - "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out
  
<uc-blockquote> My paper will focus on moral hazard behavior change because no matter the design or setting, some influence will be present. </uc-blockquote>

Kotchen and Salant offer a possible theory justification for moral hazards in the short term for fisheries. Increase the cost initially to see biological improvements, insurers bear the initial cost.

Utility is concave

# Adding Basis Risk into model 

$$\begin{pmatrix}
z \\
w 
\end{pmatrix}\sim N\left(\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_z^2 & \rho\sigma_z\sigma_w \\
\rho\sigma_w\sigma_z & \sigma_w^2
\end{pmatrix}\right)$$

The joint distribution of the random variables $z$ and $w$ is connected through a copula that uses $\rho$ as the correlation between the index and productivity shock. Update the utility maximization with all variables.

# Potential to leverage insurance induced moral hazards to correct externalities in fisheries

##.bold[Moral Hazard]: .gold[*"Decisions by insured agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured"*]

## Moral Hazards are often undesirable in insurance

- Farmer intentionally reduces yield to get an insurance payout

## .small[In fisheries with risk-sharing agreements, moral hazards leads to reduced overexploitation]

- Revenue club encourages free riders to reduce total harvest


???

Sky diving example of moral hazard

Need to know more about how moral hazards can change behavior

Heintzelman et al., 2008 and Tillman 2018 primary backbones in this idea.

Kotchen and Salant offer a possible theory justification for moral hazards in the short term for fisheries. Increase the cost initially to see biological improvements, insurers bear the initial cost.

# What Moral Hazards exist in a fishery

## Two components of Moral Hazards

  -   "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  -   "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out
  
<uc-blockquote> How can we design insurance to induce positive behavior change? </uc-blockquote>

???

Conditions where the two components may have opposite, confounding effects

If we can elicit positive change, we can make it incentive compatible
