# Fishing is a risky business

.pull-left[
- Fishing is vulnerable to stochastic weather shocks

- Shocks are becoming more frequent and devastating

    - Marine Heat Wave in 2015 in the Pacific
    
    - Warm water and disease collapsed 95% of the New York scallop fishery in 2019

- Limited access to financial tools to smooth risk and stabilize income

## _Push to use Insurance as a means to transfer fisher risk_

???

Easy for recreational fishers to shrug off uncertainty, but what if this catch is your livelihood? The incentives to ensure catch may suddenly be higher pushing fishers to choose strategies that hurt the underlying biomass

# Index Insurance leading candidate for fisheries insurance

## .seagreen[No overarching framework to ask How? Where? and Should? index insurance be used in fisheries]

???
Specifically designed for quick payouts, flexible trigger design, and minimize moral hazard

By offering an insurance contract fishers may reoptimze their effort decisions

# Research Questions

## 1) Will index insurance change optimal input use?

  - Overfishing remains a driver of fishery collapse
    
  - At a minimum, insurance should not increase fishing pressures
    
  - Perhaps it incentives behavior change that relieves fishing pressure

## 2) What conditions lead to viable index insurance products where fishers demand insurance and insurers willing to provide?

# Insurance leads to moral hazards

##.bold[Moral Hazard]: .gold[*"Decisions by insured agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured"*]

## Two components of Moral Hazards

  -   "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  -   "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out


<uc-blockquote> Index Insurance negates "Chasing the Trigger", but is still subject to Risk Reduction and therefore may cause fishers to change their input decisions </uc-blockquote>

# Risk effects on input use

- Input risk effects dictate whether a farmer wants to add more or less inputs .small[(Ramaswami 1993; Horowitz and Lichtenberg, 1993)]

- Risk-decreasing inputs lower with insurance

# Do fishery inputs have risk effects?

- Probably, but not often described or modeled

- Fishers respond to risk

    - Inputs have more spatial and temporal variety than agriculture, so captains choose known locations and good times
    
    - Fishers prefer consistency in harvest 
    
    - "Sometimes if I don't make enough money to pay my crew, I make one or two days more. If I can get $5,000 or $10,000 more it's OK"  (Holland 2008)


Empirically, marginal inputs such as fuel and labor may be risk-decreasing while fixed inputs such as vessel size may be risk-increasing .small[(Asche et al., 2020)]

# Discussion

.bold[.blue[Index Insurance is feasible in fisheries, but will have different impacts depending on the risk effects of the input]]

## Immediate Questions

- Do you buy the risk effect specification and its importance?

- What other considerations would you consider for proving insurance feasibility?

## Future goals and questions

- Move to two input model with mixed risk effects

- Can we identify risk effects of a fishery without expensive and time-consuming empirical studies?

- Test correlations of fisheries with potential indices

# One previous attempt at fishing productivty insurance

Concluded a US RMA like revenue and yield insurance program would be unsuccessful. Instead better management is the solution (Herrmann et al., 2004)

1. Insurance cost deemed to high to US RMA standards

2. Difficulty in defining fishery peril (how exactly does weather impact a fisher?)

3. Moral hazard of "fishing the insurance"
  
  - Operators staying in when earning payouts instead of exiting
  
No definitive follow up study in 20 years and interest in fizzled out
  
<uc-blockquote>However, insurance may be possible in other fisheries. New insurance products and fishery technology have come online to improve viability of insurance. Behavior was ignored in determining fisher responses and there was no formalization of the full moral hazard effect </uc-blockquote>

---

# Moral Hazards will always influence behavior

##.bold[Moral Hazard]: .gold[*"Decisions by insured agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured"*]

## Two components of Moral Hazards

  -   "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  -   "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out


<uc-blockquote> Index Insurance negates "Chasing the Trigger", but is still subject to Risk Reduction and therefore may cause fishers to change their input decisions </uc-blockquote>
---

# There are three pathways for insurance to change behavior

1. Quid Pro Quo

  - Fishers want insurance and are willing to agree to conservation improving stipulations

2. Collection Action

  - Insurance leverages the political economy to pressure the regulator or promote collective cooperation

3. Moral Hazards

  - "Risk Reduction" : With insurance I want to take more risk than before because insurance protects me
  
  - "Chasing the Trigger" : If I change my behavior, I increase the probability of getting paid out
  
<uc-blockquote> My paper will focus on moral hazard behavior change because no matter the design or setting, some influence will be present. </uc-blockquote>
  
  
???

Kotchen and Salant offer a possible theory justification for moral hazards in the short term for fisheries. Increase the cost initially to see biological improvements, insurers bear the initial cost.

The joint distribution of the random variables $z$ and $w$ is connected through a copula that uses $\rho$ as the correlation between the index and productivity shock. Update the utility maximization with all variables.
